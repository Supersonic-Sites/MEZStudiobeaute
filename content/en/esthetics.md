    question: What is semi-permanent makeup?
    answer: Micro-shading, permanent eyeliner, lip blush is a semi-permanent make-up
      is a complexion treatment to enhance eyes, brows and lips to add
      definition to the face. This technique involves injecting pigment through
      a fine vibrating needle into the most superficial layers of the
      skin.<br><br>Microblading is a cosmetic tattooing procedure that fills in
      thin eyebrow areas to make them look fuller. Unlike a traditional tattoo,
      which is permanent, the coloring from microblading may last for up to 3
      years. This is because microblading uses different tools and a smaller
      amount of pigment. The initial procedure may take up to a 2 hours, and the
      eyebrows will appear darker immediately after the initial treatment.

      appearance of acne scars and stretch marks, premature aging, dark spots,
      hyperpigmentation, alopecia.
    faqs:
      - question: Why microneeding must be performed on the face and neck?

          - Reduced skin elasticity<br>
          - Uneven skin tone<br>
      - question: What to expect from microneedling?
        answer: After you have a microneedling procedure, some side effects are to be

        answer: The redness and swelling will most likely persist for 24 hours or

      - question: Microneedling aftercare?

          between them will vary by type, location, and skin concern.

        answer: >-

          needles to encourage the production of collagen and increase firmness
          within the skin.<br>

          - You’ll also need to avoid swimming pools, saunas, and situations where you might sweat heavily, including intense workouts at the gym, to protect your newly treated skin. After 72 hours have passed, you may be able to resume these activities.<br>
      - question: Who is not eligible to microdermabrasion?
        answer: >-
          Microdermabrasion is not recommended for people who have deep scars,
          active keloids, undiagnosed lesions, a recent herpes outbreak, warts
          on the face, skin cancer, active acne (stages 3 and 4), sunburns or
          active rosacea, eczema, an auto-immune system disorder, or unstable
          diabetes.<br><br>  

          Pregnant women should not undergo microdermabrasion.  Individuals with deep scars, facial creases, or other moderate-to-severe skin defects should consider a stronger treatment such as a chemical peel or laser skin resurfacing.
      - question: How many treatments of microdermabrasion are required?
        answer: Initially 5 to 8 treatments spaced 7-10 days apart are recommended for
          most people.  Acne scars and or discolorations may require more
          treatments.  Monthly maintenance treatments every 2 or 3 months may be
          necessary to maintain results.

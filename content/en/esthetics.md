    question: What is semi-permanent makeup?
    answer: Micro-shading, permanent eyeliner, lip blush is a semi-permanent make-up
      is a complexion treatment to enhance eyes, brows and lips to add
      definition to the face. This technique involves injecting pigment through
      a fine vibrating needle into the most superficial layers of the
      skin.<br><br>Microblading is a cosmetic tattooing procedure that fills in
      thin eyebrow areas to make them look fuller. Unlike a traditional tattoo,
      which is permanent, the coloring from microblading may last for up to 3
      years. This is because microblading uses different tools and a smaller
      amount of pigment. The initial procedure may take up to a 2 hours, and the
      eyebrows will appear darker immediately after the initial treatment.

      - question: What is microneedling?
        answer: Microneedling is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that’s used to
          treat skin concerns via collagen production. Also known as collagen
          induction therapy, this treatment may help those looking to reduce the
          appearance of acne scars and stretch marks, premature aging, dark
          spots, hyperpigmentation, alopecia.
      - question: Why microneeding must be performed on the face and neck?
        answer: |
          Microneedling is effective for the following concerns:
          - Acne scars<br>
          - Age spots (also called “sun spots”)<br>
          - Fine lines and wrinkles<br>
          - Uncontrollable oily skin<br>
          - Large pores<br>
          - Reduced skin elasticity<br>
          - Uneven skin tone<br>
      - question: What to expect from microneedling?
        answer: After you have a microneedling procedure, some side effects are to be
          expected. When you leave your appointment, your skin may be flushed or
          bright red.
      - question: How long will it take for the redness of microneedling to disapear?
        answer: >
          The redness and swelling will most likely persist for 24 hours or
          slightly longer. Even with careful aftercare, there isn’t much you can
          do to get rid of the redness immediately after microneedling.
      - question: Microneedling aftercare?
        answer: >
          - As a general rule, you should reach for sunscreen constantly for the
          first 2 weeks after microneedling. Make sure to apply sunscreen
          anytime you go outside in the days following your treatment.<br>

          - Don’t spend prolonged time out in the sun for the first week after your microneedling procedure, as you’ll be more prone to sun damage than usual.<br>

          - Use any topical antibiotic cream that your doctor prescribes to avoid infection.

          Wash your hands before you touch your face.<br>

          - Don’t put on makeup, especially with a makeup brush that has been used before, in the 24 hours following microneedling.<br>

          - You’ll also need to avoid swimming pools, saunas, and situations where you might sweat heavily, including intense workouts at the gym, to protect your newly treated skin. After 72 hours have passed, you may be able to resume these activities.<br>
      - question: Who is not eligible for microneedling?
        answer: |
          - Women who are pregnant<br>
          - Have certain skin diseases, such as psoriasis or eczema<br>
          - Have open wounds<br>
          - Have had radiation therapy recently<br>
          - Have a history of skin scars<br>
      - question: How many treatments of microneedling are required?
        answer: Microneedling typically requires nine months of treatment. During this
          time, you'll need three to six treatments spaced out every two to six
          weeks to see full results. The exact number of treatments and the time
          between them will vary by type, location, and skin concern.
      - question: What is the difference between microdermabrasion and microneedling?
        answer: >
          - Microdermabrasion uses vacuum and crystal technology to deeply
          exfoliate and unclog the skin whereas Microneedling uses micro-fine
          needles to encourage the production of collagen and increase firmness
          within the skin.<br>

          - Microdermabrasion is best for treating clogged pores, tired/dull skin and blackheads whereas Microneedling is great for treating acne scarring, stretchmarks and lines and wrinkles.<br>

          - Microdermabrasion is not invasive however as microneedling involves needles rolling over the skin, there may be some bleeding during treatment.<br>
      - question: What is microdermabrasion?
        answer: >
          Microdermabrasion is a minimally invasive procedure used to renew
          overall skin tone and texture. It can improve the appearance of sun
          damage, wrinkles, fine lines, age spots, acne scarring, melasma, and
          other skin-related concerns and conditions.<br><br>

          The procedure uses a special applicator with an abrasive surface to gently sand away the thick outer layer of the skin to rejuvenate it.
      - question: Is microdermabrasion safe?
        answer: >
          Microdermabrasion is considered a safe procedure for most skin types
          and colors. People might choose to get the procedure if they have the
          following skin concerns:<br>

          - Fine lines and wrinkles<br>

          - Hyperpigmentation, age spots and brown spots<br>

          - Enlarged pores and blackheads<br>

          - Acne and acne scars<br>

          - Stretch marks<br>

          - Dull-looking skin complexion<br>

          - Uneven skin tone and texture<br>

          - Melasma<br>

          - Sun damage<br>
      - question: What is the aftercare for microdermabrasion?
        answer: >-
          - As a general rule, you should reach for sunscreen constantly for the
          first 2 weeks after microneedling. Make sure to apply sunscreen
          anytime you go outside in the days following your treatment.<br>

          - Don’t spend prolonged time out in the sun for the first week after your microneedling procedure, as you’ll be more prone to sun damage than usual.<br>

          - Use any topical antibiotic cream that your doctor prescribes to avoid infection.<br>

          - Wash your hands before you touch your face.<br>

          - Don’t put on makeup, especially with a makeup brush that has been used before, in the 24 hours following microneedling.<br>

          - You’ll also need to avoid swimming pools, saunas, and situations where you might sweat heavily, including intense workouts at the gym, to protect your newly treated skin. After 72 hours have passed, you may be able to resume these activities.<br>
      - question: Who is not eligible to microdermabrasion?
        answer: >
          Microdermabrasion is not recommended for people who have deep scars,
          active keloids, undiagnosed lesions, a recent herpes outbreak, warts
          on the face, skin cancer, active acne (stages 3 and 4), sunburns or
          active rosacea, eczema, an auto-immune system disorder, or unstable
          diabetes.<br><br>  

          Pregnant women should not undergo microdermabrasion.  Individuals with deep scars, facial creases, or other moderate-to-severe skin defects should consider a stronger treatment such as a chemical peel or laser skin resurfacing.
      - question: How many treatments of microdermabrasion are required?
        answer: Initially 5 to 8 treatments spaced 7-10 days apart are recommended for
          most people.  Acne scars and or discolorations may require more
          treatments.  Monthly maintenance treatments every 2 or 3 months may be
          necessary to maintain results.
